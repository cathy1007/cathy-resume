            <p>Hey George!</p>
            <p>so,i have done digging here and there and i think that the best options woulde be to take the american alrline. the price is fine and comparing to others,it is even competitive.hah!</p>
            <p>though,i think we still need to meet sarch to seee if she can get us a better price.</p>
            <p>cheers,<br/>
